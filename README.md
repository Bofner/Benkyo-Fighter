# Thanks for checking out BENKYO FIGHTER! 

This is a project I'm working on as part of my final semester of my masters degree in computer science. Benkyo Fighter will be an arcade style free-roaming shoot-em-up game for the Sega Master System written entirely in z80 assembly. It will be released in chapter segments, with my Master's project being something of a test chapter for getting the engine up and running with only a few hints as to what the main story will be about.

This repository will act as a way to catalogue this project, and as soon as I figure out how I want to format things, it will also act as a tutorial of sorts (At least for chapter 0), outlining my process, and discussing the tools that I found to be most helpful in learning my first assmebly language, as well as creating assets and everything else involved in game design.

For now, I recommend starting off learning z80 for one of Texas Instruments 83 series calculators, like the TI-84+, as it uses the same z80 cpu as the Sega Master System, but has more resources for learning how to code. Specifically Sean McLaughlin's Learn TI-83 Plus Assembly In 28 Days (https://tutorials.eeems.ca/ASMin28Days/lesson/toc.html). You'll need to find a different assembler, but I'll update all of that info in due time.
