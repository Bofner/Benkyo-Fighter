# Thanks for checking out Warning Forever! 

This is a project I'm working on as part of my final semester of my masters degree in computer science. 
Warning Forever is an arcade style free-roaming shoot-em-up game for the Sega Master System in z80 assembly. 

This repository will act as a way to catalogue this project, and as soon as I figure out how I want to format 
things, it will also act as a tutorial of sorts, outlining my process, and discussing the tools that I found
to be most helpful in learning my first assmebly language. 

For now, I recommend starting off learning z80 for one of Texas Instruments 83 series calculators, like the TI-84+, 
as it uses the same z80 cpu as the Sega Master System, but has more resources for learning how to code. Specifically 
Sean McLaughlin's Learn TI-83 Plus Assembly In 28 Days (https://tutorials.eeems.ca/ASMin28Days/lesson/toc.html). 
You'll need to find a different assembler, but I'll update all of that info in due time. 

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions at a.bofner@gmail.com
